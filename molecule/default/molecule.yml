    # Comment this out to not destroy a running container when you run 'molecule test' again.

    - create

    # Idempotence might take to long on travis right now... Let's skip it until we get this thing passing.

# Configure the "dependency" action: ansible-galaxy install.

  # You can skip the ansible-galaxy install by setting enabled: false

    # The 'ansible-galaxy' command considers the pre-existence of a role's folder an "error".
    # That command and 'molecule' will exit with failure if this flag and '--force' is not set.
    # This setup sets 'ignore-errors' to 'false' when run in Travis to make sure that automated tests will catch problems,
    # but it defaults to 'true' so it runs quickly for local developers.
